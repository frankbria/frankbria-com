## 🚀 Your Next Steps (5-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets

1. **Go to GitHub Secrets page**:
   ```
   https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/settings/secrets/actions
   ```

2. **Click "New repository secret"** and add each of these:

   **DEPLOY_HOST**
   ```
   47.88.89.175
   ```

   **DEPLOY_USER**
   ```
   root
   ```

   **DEPLOY_SSH_KEY**
   ```
   -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
   ***REMOVED***
   ***REMOVED***
   ***REMOVED***
   ***REMOVED***
   ***REMOVED***
   ***REMOVED***
   -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
   ```
   ⚠️ **Copy the entire key including BEGIN and END lines**

   **DEPLOY_FRONTEND_PATH**
   ```
   /var/nodejs/frankbria-com
   ```

### Step 2: Test the Workflow

**Option A: Manual Trigger (Recommended)**

1. Go to Actions page:
   ```
   https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/actions
   ```

2. Click **"Deploy Frontend (Next.js)"**

3. Click **"Run workflow"** button

4. Select **"development"** from dropdown

5. Click **"Run workflow"**

6. Watch the deployment happen in real-time! 🎬

**Option B: Push a Change**

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# CI/CD Enabled! 🚀" >> README.md

# Commit and push to trigger deployment
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test: Trigger automated deployment"
git push origin claude/wp-site-deployment-011CULpfpFvx2WjK4FMWRoNf
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/actions
   - You should see your workflow running
   - Green checkmark = success! ✅

2. **Check the website**:
   - Visit: https://beta.frankbria.com
   - Your changes should be live

3. **Check server logs** (optional):
   ```bash
   ssh root@47.88.89.175 "pm2 logs frankbria-nextjs --lines 50"
   ```

## 🎯 What You Get Now

### Automatic Deployments
- Push to `develop` → Auto-deploys to beta.frankbria.com
- Push to `claude/**` → Auto-deploys to beta.frankbria.com
- Push to `main` → Nothing (production disabled until ready)

### Build Verification
- Linting runs before deployment
- Build must succeed before deploying
- Failures stop deployment (protects server)

### Safety Features
- Automatic rollback if PM2 fails to start
- Health checks after deployment
- Keeps last 3 build backups

### Visibility
- Real-time deployment logs in GitHub
- Success/failure notifications
- Deployment summaries

## 📊 What Happens on Each Push

```
1. 🔍 GitHub detects push to develop
2. ⚡ Workflow triggered automatically
3. 📦 Checkout code
4. 🔧 Install dependencies
5. 🧹 Run linter (optional)
6. 🔨 Build Next.js app
7. 🔐 SSH to server (47.88.89.175)
8. 📂 Pull latest code on server
9. 🏗️  Build on server
10. ♻️  Restart PM2 process
11. 🏥 Health check
12. ✅ Deployment complete!

Total time: ~2-3 minutes
```

## 🔮 When You're Ready for Production

### To Enable Production Deployments:

1. **Add production secrets** (3 more secrets):
   - `DEPLOY_HOST_PROD` - Your production server IP
   - `DEPLOY_USER_PROD` - `root`
   - `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY_PROD` - New SSH key for production

2. **Uncomment one line** in `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml`:
   ```yaml
   branches:
     - main  # <-- Remove the # symbol
   ```

3. **Test on production server**

4. **Switch DNS from WordPress**

5. **Turn off WordPress** 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails with "Permission denied (publickey)"
- Check that you copied the ENTIRE SSH key (including BEGIN/END lines)
- Verify no extra spaces in the key
- Re-add the secret if needed

### Workflow succeeds but site doesn't update
- Check PM2 status: `ssh root@47.88.89.175 "pm2 status"`
- View PM2 logs: `ssh root@47.88.89.175 "pm2 logs frankbria-nextjs"`
- Verify build completed successfully in GitHub Actions logs

### "Error: Host key verification failed"
- This should resolve automatically on second run
- If persists, check DEPLOY_HOST value (should be `47.88.89.175`)

### Build fails with linting errors
- Fix the linting errors in your code
- Or temporarily set `continue-on-error: false` in workflow

## 🎊 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

- ✅ GitHub Actions shows green checkmark
- ✅ beta.frankbria.com shows your latest changes
- ✅ No more manual SSH commands needed
- ✅ Deployments complete in ~2-3 minutes
- ✅ Team members can deploy by just pushing code

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Draft PRs**: Draft pull requests won't trigger deployments
2. **Watch the logs**: GitHub Actions logs show exactly what's happening
3. **Test locally first**: `npm run build` before pushing
4. **Use manual trigger**: Great for specific deployments without pushing
5. **Keep backups**: The workflow keeps last 3 build backups automatically

## 🎉 You're All Set!

The hard part is done. Now just:

1. Add the 4 GitHub Secrets
2. Run a test deployment
3. Verify it works
4. Start developing!
