## 🎯 Your Next Steps (10-15 minutes)

### **Step 1: Create Development Environment**

✨ **New!** We're using GitHub Environments for better organization.

1. Go to: **https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/settings/environments**

2. Click **"New environment"**

3. Name it: `development`

4. Click **"Configure environment"**

5. **Don't add any protection rules** (for development)

6. Click **"Save protection rules"**

### **Step 2: Add Development Secrets**

In the **development** environment you just created, add these **Secrets** (🔒 encrypted):

1. **DEPLOY_HOST**
   ```
   47.88.89.175
   ```

2. **DEPLOY_USER**
   ```
   root
   ```

3. **DEPLOY_SSH_KEY**

   ⚠️ **Get the private key from your local machine**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/github-actions-dev-new
   ```

   Copy the **entire output** (including BEGIN/END lines) and paste as the secret value.

   **Note**: The public key is already on the server at 47.88.89.175

### **Step 3: Add Development Variables**

In the same **development** environment, add these **Variables** (📝 configuration):

1. **DEPLOY_PATH**
   ```
   /var/nodejs/frankbria-com
   ```

2. **SITE_URL**
   ```
   https://beta.frankbria.com
   ```

3. **STRAPI_URL**
   ```
   https://beta.frankbria.com
   ```

4. **PM2_PROCESS_NAME**
   ```
   frankbria-nextjs
   ```

💡 **Complete guide with screenshots**: `docs/GITHUB_ENVIRONMENTS_SETUP.md`

### **Step 4: Test the Workflow**

**Option A: Manual Trigger (Recommended)**

1. Go to Actions page:
   ```
   https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/actions
   ```

2. Click **"Deploy Frontend (Next.js)"**

3. Click **"Run workflow"** button

4. Select **"development"** from dropdown

5. Click **"Run workflow"**

6. Watch the deployment happen in real-time! 🎬

7. You should see:
   - Environment badge: `development`
   - Deployment URL: `https://beta.frankbria.com`

**Option B: Push a Change**

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# CI/CD with Environments! 🚀" >> README.md

# Commit and push to trigger deployment
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test: Trigger automated deployment"
git push origin claude/wp-site-deployment-011CULpfpFvx2WjK4FMWRoNf
```

### **Step 5: Verify Deployment**

1. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/actions
   - You should see your workflow running
   - Green checkmark = success! ✅
   - You'll see **"development"** environment badge

2. **Check the website**:
   - Visit: https://beta.frankbria.com
   - Your changes should be live

3. **Check deployment history**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/deployments
   - See all deployments to `development` environment

## 🎯 What You Get Now

### Automatic Deployments
- Push to `develop` → Auto-deploys to beta.frankbria.com
- Push to `claude/**` → Auto-deploys to beta.frankbria.com
- Push to `main` → Nothing (production disabled until ready)

### Environment Organization
- 🔒 **Secrets** are encrypted and hidden
- 📝 **Variables** are visible and easy to manage
- 🎯 **Clear separation** between development and production
- 📊 **Deployment tracking** in GitHub UI

### Build Verification
- Linting runs before deployment
- Build must succeed before deploying
- Failures stop deployment (protects server)

### Safety Features
- Automatic rollback if PM2 fails to start
- Health checks after deployment
- Keeps last 3 build backups

### Visibility
- Real-time deployment logs in GitHub
- Success/failure notifications
- Deployment summaries
- Environment badges showing where code is deployed

## 📊 What Happens on Each Push

```
1. 🔍 GitHub detects push to develop
2. ⚡ Workflow triggered automatically
3. 🎯 Loads "development" environment
4. 🔐 Gets secrets from development environment
5. 📦 Checkout code
6. 🔧 Install dependencies
7. 🧹 Run linter (optional)
8. 🔨 Build Next.js app (with STRAPI_URL from vars)
9. 🔐 SSH to server (DEPLOY_HOST from secrets)
10. 📂 Pull latest code on server
11. 🏗️  Build on server
12. ♻️  Restart PM2 process
13. 🏥 Health check (SITE_URL from vars)
14. ✅ Deployment complete!

Total time: ~2-3 minutes
```

## 🔮 When You're Ready for Production

### Create Production Environment:

1. **Create environment**:
   - Go to environments page
   - Create `production` environment
   - ✅ Enable "Required reviewers"
   - Add yourself as reviewer

2. **Add production secrets** (same names, different values):
   - `DEPLOY_HOST` - Your production server IP
   - `DEPLOY_USER` - `root`
   - `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` - New SSH key for production

3. **Add production variables**:
   - `DEPLOY_PATH` - `/var/nodejs/frankbria-com`
   - `SITE_URL` - `https://frankbria.com`
   - `STRAPI_URL` - `https://frankbria.com`
   - `PM2_PROCESS_NAME` - `frankbria-nextjs`

4. **Enable production deployments**:
   - Uncomment `- main` in `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml`
   - Test deployment
   - Switch DNS
   - Turn off WordPress! 🎉

## 🌟 Benefits of Using Environments

### Before (Repository Secrets)
```
DEPLOY_HOST              → Which server is this?
DEPLOY_HOST_PROD         → Which server is this?
DEPLOY_SSH_KEY           → Which key?
DEPLOY_SSH_KEY_PROD      → Which key?
DEPLOY_FRONTEND_PATH     → Where?
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL   → Which Strapi?
```
❌ **Problem**: Confusing, easy to mix up, hard to manage

### After (Environment Secrets)
```
development/
  Secrets:
    DEPLOY_HOST           → 47.88.89.175
    DEPLOY_SSH_KEY        → Dev key
  Variables:
    SITE_URL              → beta.frankbria.com
    DEPLOY_PATH           → /var/nodejs/frankbria-com

production/
  Secrets:
    DEPLOY_HOST           → Production IP
    DEPLOY_SSH_KEY        → Prod key
  Variables:
    SITE_URL              → frankbria.com
    DEPLOY_PATH           → /var/nodejs/frankbria-com
```
✅ **Better**: Crystal clear, can't mix them up, easy to manage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails with "environment is not defined"
- Verify environment name is exactly `development`
- Check environment exists in repository settings
- Refresh the page and try again

### Workflow fails with "secrets.DEPLOY_HOST is not set"
- Make sure secret is in the **environment**, not repository secrets
- Verify secret name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check you clicked "Add secret" not "Add variable"

### "Error: Permission denied (publickey)"
- Check that you copied the ENTIRE SSH key (including BEGIN/END lines)
- Verify no extra spaces in the key
- Re-add the secret if needed

### Workflow succeeds but site doesn't update
- Check PM2 status: `ssh root@47.88.89.175 "pm2 status"`
- View PM2 logs: `ssh root@47.88.89.175 "pm2 logs frankbria-nextjs"`
- Verify build completed successfully in GitHub Actions logs
