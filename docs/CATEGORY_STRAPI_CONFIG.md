- Check the **Categories** field
- Posts should have at least one category assigned

### Step 3: Test Category Pages

Once the code is deployed to `beta.frankbria.com`:

1. **Test category listing on blog page:**
   - Visit: `https://beta.frankbria.com/blog`
   - You should see category badges under each post
   - Click a category badge â†’ should go to category page

2. **Test category page directly:**
   - Find a category slug in Strapi (e.g., "business-strategy")
   - Visit: `https://beta.frankbria.com/category/business-strategy`
   - Should show all posts in that category

3. **Test individual post page:**
   - Visit any blog post

If you want to add descriptions to categories (recommended for SEO):

1. Go to **Content-Type Builder**
2. Click **Categories**
3. Click **"+ Add another field"**
4. Select **"Text"** (for short description) or **"Rich text"** (for longer description)

8. Restart Strapi (server will prompt you)

### Then Update Existing Categories:

1. Go to **Content Manager â†’ Categories**
2. Edit each category
3. Add a description (e.g., "Insights and strategies for scaling your business to 7 figures")
4. Save and Publish

The category pages will automatically display the description if it exists.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Category pages show 404

**Cause:** Category doesn't exist in Strapi or has no slug

**Fix:**
1. Go to Strapi Admin â†’ Categories
2. Verify category exists
3. Check that `slug` field is filled (should auto-generate)
4. Re-save and publish the category

### Issue: No posts showing on category page

**Cause:** Posts don't have that category assigned

**Fix:**
1. Go to Strapi Admin â†’ Posts
2. Edit posts that should be in this category
3. Add the category in the **Categories** field
4. Save and Publish

### Issue: Category badge not clickable on blog page

**Cause:** Post category doesn't have a `slug` field

**Fix:**
1. Go to Strapi Admin â†’ Categories
2. Edit the category
3. The slug should auto-generate from the name
4. If not, re-type the name and save
5. Publish

### Issue: API returns empty categories array

**Cause:** Posts not published or relationship not saved

**Fix:**
1. Edit the post in Strapi
2. Re-select categories
3. Click **Save**
4. Click **Publish**
5. Wait 5 minutes for cache to clear (or rebuild Next.js)

## API Endpoints

The category pages use these Strapi API endpoints:

### Get All Categories
```
GET https://beta.frankbria.com/api/categories?populate=*&sort=name:asc
```

### Get Category by Slug
```
GET https://beta.frankbria.com/api/categories?filters[slug][$eq]=business-strategy&populate=*
```

### Get Posts by Category
```
GET https://beta.frankbria.com/api/posts?filters[categories][slug][$eq]=business-strategy&populate=*&sort=publishedDate:desc&pagination[page]=1&pagination[pageSize]=12
```

You can test these in your browser or with curl to verify data is returning correctly.

## Example Categories

Based on the WordPress migration, you should have categories like:

- Business Strategy (`business-strategy`)
- Marketing (`marketing`)
- Sales (`sales`)
- Leadership (`leadership`)
- Technology (`technology`)
- Uncategorized (`uncategorized`)

Visit these URLs once deployed:
- `https://beta.frankbria.com/category/business-strategy`
- `https://beta.frankbria.com/category/marketing`
- `https://beta.frankbria.com/category/sales`

## Performance Notes

### Caching Strategy

Category pages use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
- Pages are pre-rendered at build time
- Regenerate every 5 minutes
- Fast page loads + fresh content

### When Changes Appear

After updating categories or posts in Strapi:
1. **Immediately**: Changes visible in Strapi Admin
2. **Within 5 minutes**: Changes visible on website (ISR)
3. **Instantly (force)**: Run `npm run build` and redeploy

âœ… **Ready to use immediately** - Just deploy the code
