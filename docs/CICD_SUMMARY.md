# GitHub Actions CI/CD - Executive Summary

## 🎯 What This Solves

Eliminates manual SSH deployments by automating the entire deployment pipeline for both Next.js frontend and Strapi backend to **two separate servers**:
- **Development Server** (47.88.89.175) → beta.frankbria.com
- **Production Server** (existing, ready to go) → frankbria.com

## 🏗️ Your Infrastructure

### Current State
```
WordPress Server  ───────►  frankbria.com (to be replaced)
Dev Server        ───────►  beta.frankbria.com (active)
Production Server ───────►  (provisioned, waiting for MVP)
```

### After Implementation
```
Development (47.88.89.175)
├─ Auto-deploys: develop, claude/** branches
├─ URL: beta.frankbria.com
└─ Use: Testing and development

Production (existing IP)
├─ Auto-deploys: main branch (DISABLED until MVP approved)
├─ URL: frankbria.com
├─ Replaces: WordPress server
└─ Use: Live production site
```

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Development CI/CD (Now)
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Zero (production untouched)

**What happens**:
1. Create GitHub Actions workflows
2. Add development server SSH key to GitHub Secrets
3. Test deployment to beta.frankbria.com
4. Refine and iterate on development

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Automatic deployment on push to `develop` or `claude/**`
- ✅ Build verification before deployment
- ✅ Health checks after deployment
- ✅ No more manual SSH commands for development

### Phase 2: Production Launch (When MVP Approved)
**Timeline**: 1 day (mostly waiting for DNS)
**Risk**: Low (with proper rollback plan)

**What happens**:
1. Add production server SSH key to GitHub Secrets
2. Uncomment `main` branch in workflows
3. Test production deployment
4. Switch DNS from WordPress to new stack
5. **Turn off WordPress server** 🎉

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Automatic deployment on push to `main`
- ✅ Separate production and development environments
- ✅ WordPress migration complete
- ✅ Full CI/CD for both environments

## 🔐 Security

### SSH Key Authentication
- **Development Key**: For 47.88.89.175
- **Production Key**: For production server (separate key)
- Both stored encrypted in GitHub Secrets
- No passwords, no credential exposure

### Branch Protection
- `main` branch deployments disabled until you enable them
- Can add approval requirements before production deployment
- All changes tracked in git history

## 💰 Cost

**GitHub Actions**: $0 (within free tier)
**Additional Infrastructure**: $0 (servers already exist)
**Total**: $0/month

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success
- ✅ Zero manual SSH deployments to development
- ✅ Deployment time reduced from ~5 min to ~2 min
- ✅ Build failures caught before reaching server
- ✅ 100% deployment success rate

### Phase 2 Success
- ✅ WordPress server decommissioned
- ✅ Zero downtime during cutover
- ✅ Production and development isolated
- ✅ Confidence in automated deployments

## 🚀 Quick Start

### To Enable Development CI/CD Today

1. **Generate SSH key**:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-dev" -f ~/.ssh/github-actions-dev
```

2. **Add public key to development server**:
```bash
ssh root@47.88.89.175
cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys << 'EOF'
[paste public key here]
EOF
```

3. **Add secrets to GitHub**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/frankbria/frankbria-com/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add:
     - `DEPLOY_HOST`: `47.88.89.175`
     - `DEPLOY_USER`: `root`
     - `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`: [paste private key]
     - `DEPLOY_FRONTEND_PATH`: `/var/nodejs/frankbria-com`

4. **Create workflow files** (I'll implement these)

5. **Test**: Push a change to `develop` branch

### To Enable Production CI/CD Later

1. **Add production secrets to GitHub**:
   - `DEPLOY_HOST_PROD`: [production server IP]
   - `DEPLOY_USER_PROD`: `root`
   - `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY_PROD`: [new SSH key for production]

2. **Uncomment one line** in `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml`:
```yaml
branches:
  - main  # <-- Uncomment this
```

3. **Test**: Push to `main` branch (or use manual trigger)

4. **Cutover**: Update DNS, turn off WordPress

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What's DISABLED by Default
- ❌ Production deployments (main branch)
- ❌ Automatic database migrations
- ❌ Production secrets (need to be added)

### What's ENABLED by Default
- ✅ Development deployments (develop, claude/** branches)
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Health checks
- ✅ Automatic rollback on failure

### What You Control
- ✅ When to enable production deployments
- ✅ When to switch DNS from WordPress
- ✅ When to decommission WordPress server
- ✅ All deployment triggers and settings

## 🎬 Next Steps

**Option 1**: Implement Phase 1 now (development CI/CD)
- Safe to do immediately
- Zero risk to production
- Improves development workflow today

**Option 2**: Review and approve design first
- Ask questions
- Suggest modifications
- Ensure alignment with requirements

**Option 3**: Wait until closer to MVP
- Keep manual deployments for now
- Implement CI/CD when MVP is ready
- Bundle with production launch

**My Recommendation**: **Option 1** - Implement Phase 1 now. It's:
- Zero risk (production unchanged)
- High value (eliminates manual dev deployments)
- Good practice (test CI/CD before production launch)
- Easy to test (can disable if issues arise)

## 🤝 Questions to Consider

Before we proceed, confirm:

1. ✅ **Production server ready?** Yes (you mentioned it's provisioned)
2. ✅ **Separate production/dev servers?** Yes (Option B - what you have)
3. ✅ **WordPress cutover plan?** Yes (DNS switch after MVP approved)
4. ⏸️ **Production server IP?** (We'll need this for Phase 2)
5. ⏸️ **Production database setup?** (Strapi needs production DB)
6. ⏸️ **SSL certificates?** (Nginx/Caddy/Cloudflare for HTTPS)

**Ready to proceed?** Let me know and I can:
- Implement Phase 1 (development CI/CD) now
- Create detailed production cutover checklist
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Document runbooks for common issues
