---

## 1. Missing Features to Develop

These are legitimate features from frankbria.com that should be replicated on beta.frankbria.com:

### 1.1 Search Functionality ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Production Site:**
- Search box in header (top right)
- Searches blog posts by title and content
- Returns results page with matching posts

**Beta Site:**
- No search functionality

**Implementation Notes:**
- Can be implemented with Strapi's built-in search filters
- Use `/api/posts?filters[$or][0][title][$contains]=query&filters[$or][1][content][$contains]=query`
- Create `/search` page with search results component
- Add search input to header navigation

**Strapi Compatible:** ✅ Yes - Use Strapi filters API

---

### 1.2 Related Posts Section ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Production Site:**
- Shows 3 related posts at bottom of each blog post
- Titled "Related"
- Shows post image, title, date, and category

**Beta Site:**
- No related posts section

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use categories to find related posts
- Query: `/api/posts?filters[categories][id][$in]=${categoryIds}&filters[id][$ne]=${currentPostId}&pagination[pageSize]=3`
- Add `RelatedPosts` component to blog post template
- Should show posts from same categories, excluding current post

**Strapi Compatible:** ✅ Yes - Use category relationships

---

### 1.3 Email Sharing ⭐ LOW PRIORITY
**Production Site:**
- Social sharing includes email option
- Uses `mailto:` link with pre-filled subject and body

**Beta Site:**
- Social sharing exists (X, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Missing email sharing option

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add email icon to social sharing component
- Format: `mailto:?subject=[Post Title]&body=[Post URL]`
- Pure frontend implementation (no backend needed)

**Strapi Compatible:** ✅ Yes - Frontend only

---

### 1.4 Mobile Menu (Hamburger) ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Production Site:**
- Responsive hamburger menu on mobile
- Slides in from right side

**Beta Site:**
- Navigation is visible but may not be mobile-optimized
- Need to verify mobile responsiveness

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add mobile menu component with hamburger icon
- Should show/hide on click
- Include all navigation links (Home, Blog)
- Use CSS media queries for responsive behavior

**Strapi Compatible:** ✅ Yes - Frontend only

---

### 1.5 Cookie Consent Banner ⚠️ LEGAL REQUIREMENT
**Production Site:**
- Cookie consent popup on first visit
- "Cookie settings" and "ACCEPT" buttons
- Stores consent in browser localStorage

**Beta Site:**
- No cookie consent banner

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Legal requirement** for GDPR compliance
- Implement cookie consent library (e.g., `react-cookie-consent`)
- Should appear on first visit only
- Store consent in localStorage
- Include "Cookie settings" and "Accept" options

**Strapi Compatible:** ✅ Yes - Frontend only, no Strapi involvement

---

### 1.6 "Older Entries" Navigation (Blog Archive) ⭐ LOW PRIORITY
**Production Site:**
- Blog listing shows "« Older Entries" link
- Links to `/blog/page/2/`
- Multi-page archive of all posts

**Beta Site:**
- Has pagination with "1, 2, ... 18, Next"
- More modern pagination UI
- Functionally equivalent but different UX

**Implementation Notes:**
- Current implementation is actually **better** than production
- Consider this a **non-issue** unless user specifically wants WordPress-style pagination
- Current "Next/Previous" with page numbers is more user-friendly

**Strapi Compatible:** ✅ Already implemented (better version)

---

## 2. WordPress-Specific Features (DO NOT Replicate)

These features are specific to WordPress and should NOT be migrated:

### 2.1 WordPress Admin Bar
**What it is:** Top admin bar visible to logged-in WordPress users
**Why skip:** Not applicable to Strapi (has its own admin at `/admin`)

### 2.2 DISQUS Comments System
**What it is:** WordPress uses DISQUS for blog comments
**Why skip:**
- Not loading on production site (console error: "Could not find 'disqus_thread' container")
- Comments systems are rarely used on modern blogs
- Can add later if specifically requested
- **Recommendation:** Skip unless user explicitly requests

### 2.3 WordPress Jetpack Features
**What it is:** Social media auto-posting, stats, etc.
**Why skip:**
- WordPress plugin-specific
- Strapi has alternatives or different approaches
- Not visible to end users

### 2.4 WordPress Theme Settings
**What it is:** Divi/Elegant Themes customization options
**Why skip:**
- Theme-specific
- Next.js uses custom components instead

### 2.5 WordPress Search Widget
**What it is:** WordPress search functionality
**Why replicate differently:**
- Listed in "Missing Features" above
- Needs custom implementation with Strapi API
- Not a direct port of WordPress feature

---

## 3. Strapi-Incompatible Features (DO NOT Attempt)

These features cannot or should not be replicated due to architectural differences:

### 3.1 WordPress Post Revisions
**What it is:** WordPress tracks every edit to a post
**Why incompatible:**
- Strapi has its own draft/publish system
- Different versioning approach
- Not user-facing

### 3.2 WordPress Shortcodes
**What it is:** [shortcode] tags in post content
**Why incompatible:**
- WordPress-specific syntax
- Strapi uses rich text or Markdown
- If found in migrated content, should be converted to HTML

### 3.3 WordPress Custom Fields (ACF)
**What it is:** Additional metadata on posts
**Why incompatible:**
- Strapi has its own custom field system
- Already configured in Strapi schema
- Different implementation

### 3.4 WordPress Media Library Management
**What it is:** WordPress media upload/management
**Why incompatible:**
- Strapi has its own media library
- Different upload approach
- Already handled in migration

### 3.5 WordPress Plugins (General)
**What it is:** WordPress plugins (SEO, forms, analytics, etc.)
**Why incompatible:**
- Next.js/Strapi use different approaches
- Many features handled differently:
  - SEO: Next.js metadata API
  - Forms: Custom React components
  - Analytics: Google Analytics script in layout
- Evaluate each on case-by-case basis

---

## 8. Technical Implementation Notes

### 8.1 Search Implementation
```typescript
// lib/strapi.ts
export async function searchPosts(query: string, page = 1, pageSize = 12) {
  const client = getStrapiClient();
  const response = await client.get('/posts', {
    params: {
      'filters[$or][0][title][$containsi]': query,
      'filters[$or][1][content][$containsi]': query,
      'populate': '*',
      'pagination[page]': page,
      'pagination[pageSize]': pageSize,
      'sort': 'publishedDate:desc',
    }
  });
  return response.data;
}
```

### 8.2 Related Posts Implementation
```typescript
// lib/strapi.ts
export async function getRelatedPosts(postId: number, categoryIds: number[], limit = 3) {
  const client = getStrapiClient();
  const response = await client.get('/posts', {
    params: {
      'filters[categories][id][$in]': categoryIds,
      'filters[id][$ne]': postId,
      'populate': '*',
      'pagination[pageSize]': limit,
      'sort': 'publishedDate:desc',
    }
  });
  return response.data;
}
```

### 8.3 Cookie Consent Implementation
```bash
npm install react-cookie-consent
```

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import CookieConsent from 'react-cookie-consent';

// Add to layout:
<CookieConsent
  location="bottom"
  buttonText="ACCEPT"
  declineButtonText="Cookie settings"
  enableDeclineButton
  cookieName="frankbria-cookie-consent"
>
  This website uses cookies to improve your experience.
</CookieConsent>
```

## 9. Additional Pages to Check

The research focused on homepage, blog, and individual posts. Additional pages may exist that need verification:

### Potential Pages to Review:
- `/about` - About page
- `/contact` - Contact form
- `/services` - Services offered
- `/podcast` - Podcast page (redirects to external URL currently)
- `/earnings-disclaimer` - Legal page (linked in footer)
- `/terms` - Terms and Conditions (linked in footer)
- `/privacy-policy` - Privacy Policy (linked in footer)

**Action Required:** Check if these pages exist on production and need migration.

---

## 10. Known Issues & Notes

### 10.1 Console Errors on Production
- DISQUS error: "Could not find 'disqus_thread' container"
- Failed resource: `remind.growthtools.com` (404)
- These are existing issues on production, not migration problems

### 10.2 Beta Site Console Errors
- React error #418 on single post page (HTML parsing)
- Likely due to WordPress HTML content with non-standard tags
- May need content sanitization in Strapi

### 10.3 Image Handling
- Production uses WordPress media library
- Beta should use Strapi media library
- Verify all post images migrated correctly

### 10.4 External Links
- Several brand links go to external sites (htp.frankbria.com, frankbriamusic.com, etc.)
- These are intentional and working correctly on both sites

---

## 11. Final Recommendations

### ✅ DO THIS:
1. Implement cookie consent banner (legal requirement)
2. Add search functionality (high user value)
3. Verify/enhance mobile menu
4. Add related posts section
5. Complete social sharing with email option
6. Review and verify all additional pages exist

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
1. Try to replicate WordPress admin features
2. Port WordPress plugins directly
3. Implement DISQUS comments (broken on prod, low value)
4. Copy WordPress theme-specific features
5. Attempt to match WordPress exactly (beta improvements are better)

### 🤔 EVALUATE CASE-BY-CASE:
1. Comments system (only if user explicitly requests)
2. Additional WordPress plugins found during review
3. Custom WordPress functionality not yet discovered
