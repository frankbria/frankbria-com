# CI/CD Pipeline Test

This commit triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to verify that the peer dependency fixes (commit 08d4ca2) resolve the deployment pipeline failure.

Expected outcome:
- ✅ npm ci succeeds (no peer dependency conflicts)
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Deployment to beta.frankbria.com succeeds
