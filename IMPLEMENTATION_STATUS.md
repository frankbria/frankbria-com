## Test Coverage Targets

| Component | Target Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| CookieConsent | >90% | Pending |
| Search (All) | >85% | Pending |
| Mobile Menu | >90% | Pending |
| Related Posts | >85% | Pending |
| Email Sharing | >90% | Pending |
| **Overall** | **>85%** | **Pending** |

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Teams implement features following TDD workflow
3. Run `npm test:coverage` to generate coverage report
4. Verify all tests pass with 100% pass rate
5. Verify coverage exceeds 85% threshold
6. Integration testing
7. Deploy to beta

---

## Command Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test:coverage

# Run tests in CI mode
npm test:ci

# Run specific test file
npm test -- components/__tests__/CookieConsent.test.tsx
```

## TDD Workflow for Each Team

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**RED:**
1. Write a failing test
2. Run test to confirm it fails
3. Verify failure is for the right reason

**GREEN:**
4. Write minimal code to make test pass
5. Run test to confirm it passes
6. Don't add extra features yet

**REFACTOR:**
7. Clean up code while keeping tests green
8. Improve structure, naming, performance
9. Run tests to ensure they still pass

### Repeat for each feature until complete

---

## Quality Gates

Before marking feature complete:
- [ ] All tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Coverage >85% for the feature
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint warnings
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
